This post covers the simplest form of the problem where some of the complexity is removed via constraints. The problem revolves around efficiently processing a data model definiton and can be summarised as follows:
Given an entity-relationship(ER) model with only many-to-many relationships and multiple isolated workers, with each worker having the following properties:</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://mackle.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 16:54:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mackle.io/about/</guid><description>Hey!
